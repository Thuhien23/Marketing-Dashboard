**Focus on High-Performing Platforms:**
Instagram and Facebook deliver high CTR and conversions. Allocate more budget toward these platforms for campaigns with proven success (e.g., Limited Edition, Exclusive Offers).

**Optimize Campaigns with High Costs:**
Campaigns like Flash Sales have a higher cost per conversion. Focus on optimizing targeting and ad placements to reduce costs and improve conversion rates.

**Increase Budget During High-Performance Days:**
As revenue peaks on Fridays and Sundays, consider increasing ad spend or launching key promotions on these days to maximize ROI.

**Address Declines in February:**
Revenue drops significantly in February. Investigate campaign timing, audience behavior, and potential seasonal effects to develop strategies for mitigating this dip in performance.

**Monitor Conversion Rates:**
The overall conversion rate has slightly declined (-2%), so it's essential to continuously monitor landing page performance and ad relevance to improve this metric across platforms.
